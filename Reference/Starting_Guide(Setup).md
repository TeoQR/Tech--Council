## Introduction

C++ is a programming language mostly used in competitive programming due to its incredible speed. It is also used in other areas such as game development and operating systems.

## Startup

There are two ways you can run C++ programs, either using your local machine or using an online platform

### Local

To run C++ locally, you will need a C++ compiler and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

Link to download C++ Compiler: [https://techsupportwhale.com/install-gcc-compiler-on-windows/](url)

Suggested IDEs:
- Geany: [https://www.geany.org/download/releases/] (the one under Geany release)
- Visual Studio Code: [https://code.visualstudio.com/Download]

To run the code in the respective IDEs, I suggest searching online

### Online

Unlike using local machine, you do not need to download anything for this. The recommended platform is replit ([https://replit.com/](url)) as you can save your work there. However, if you do not wish to save your work, you can also use [https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler](url) or any other online IDE for that matter
