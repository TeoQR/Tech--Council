## Arrays
Arrays allow you to store multiple variables of the same data type into one sequence. Arrays have a fixed size

Documentation: [https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_arrays.asp]

## Vectors
Vectors are essentially dynamic arrays (they don't have fixed sizes). I personally recommend using vectors instead of arrays since they're easier to use and there's not that much speed difference.

## Pairs
Pairs allow you to store two variable which may or may not have the same data type as a pair. Pairs are usually useful when combined with arrays or vectors (vector of pairs)

## Maps
Maps is a data structure which maps keys (any data type) to their respective values (also
