## Vectors
Vectors are essentially dynamic arrays (they don't have fixed sizes). I personally recommend using vectors instead of arrays since they're easier to use and there's not that much speed difference.

## Auto keyword
The auto keyword automatically assigns the correct data type to the data. This is actually a very complex feature, I recommend only using it in for loops where you're iterating items in a data structure. The reason why you shouldn't abuse it that much is because when an unexpected situation happens because of the keyword, it's a nightmare to fix.
