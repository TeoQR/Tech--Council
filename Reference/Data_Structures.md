## Arrays
Arrays allow you to store multiple variables of the same data type into one sequence. Arrays have a fixed size

Documentation: [https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_arrays.asp]

## Vectors
Vectors are essentially dynamic arrays (they don't have fixed sizes). I personally recommend using vectors instead of arrays since they're easier to use and there's not that much speed difference.

## Pairs
Pairs allow you to store two variable which may or may not have the same data type as a pair. Pairs are usually useful when combined with arrays or vectors (vector of pairs)

## Maps
Maps is like a vector but instead of using integers as index, the index can be of any data type.

## Custom data structure
Using the keyword struct, you can make your own data structure similar to how you make a class in Python. You can add methods and attributes in the struct, but I will not discuss in detail as this is not necessarily for beginners and it is advised to learn about this once you're already familiar with C++.

## Others
Some other data structures which may only be useful in competitions are:
1. Stack
2. Queue
3. Set
4. Unordered_map
5. Unordered_set
