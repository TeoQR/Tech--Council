## ASCII
You can think of ASCII as a code for characters such as alphabetical characters (a, b, c, etc) and punctuations. Converting char data type to int will change the character to its ASCII.

## Auto keyword
The auto keyword automatically assigns the correct data type to the data. This is actually a very complex feature, I recommend only using it in for loops where you're iterating items in a data structure. The reason why you shouldn't abuse it that much is because when an unexpected situation happens because of the keyword, it's a nightmare to fix.
