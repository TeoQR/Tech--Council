__Please read this note together with its corresponding C++ file (Starting_Guide.cpp)__

I suggest reading the C++ tutorial in [https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp](url), however, if that does not suffice, you can follow along in the tutorial below

## Data types

When you create a variable in C++, you have to declare what type it is.

Here's a list of the commonly used data types: [https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/data-types](url)

## Operators

Here's an explanation of the usage of the various operators in C++: [https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/operators](url)

Do note that some of the operators work differently for different data types. For example, + works as addition for numbers (int, float, etc.), but works differently for strings, which you can see in the String.cpp file

## If Else

https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_conditions.asp

Nothing much to add on except for line 17 in Starting_Guide.cpp

## Loops

While loop: [https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_while_loop.asp](url)
For loop: [https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_for_loop.asp](url)

For loops and while loops are nearly always alternatives to one another

Break and continue: [https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_break.asp](url)

Break and continue only apply to the most inner loop it is in, for more details look at the example in line 37 in the cpp file
